Excellent 👍
Session 11 is a CORE “hands-on + protocol + attack mechanics” session — CDAC loves asking
👉 flags, fingerprinting, spoofing, enumeration, SMB, password attacks, DDoS
Most questions are directly lifted from lab understanding.

Below is Session 11 MCQs in your exact CCEE format (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced).

🎯 CCEE EXAM GOLD (Session 11)
TCP flags = guaranteed MCQs
Banner grabbing → version disclosure
Enumeration = users, shares, services
SMB relay = MITM
Nessus = vulnerability scanner (not port scanner)
