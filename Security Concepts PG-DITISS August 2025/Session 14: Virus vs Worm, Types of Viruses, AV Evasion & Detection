Session 14 is a high-return malware theory session — CDAC often asks
👉 difference-based, type-based, evasion vs detection MCQs
These are straightforward marks if concepts are clean.

Below is Session 14 MCQs in your standard CCEE format (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced).

🎯 CCEE EXAM GOLD (Session 14)
Virus needs host | Worm doesn’t
Polymorphic vs Metamorphic = favorite trap
Signature fails → heuristic wins
Worm = availability killer
