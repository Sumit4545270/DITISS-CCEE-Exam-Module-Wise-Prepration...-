Excellent 👍
Below is Session 3 MCQs designed purely from CCEE exam + lab execution perspective.
Focus here is risk identification, threat modeling logic, HTTP understanding, and Burp Suite usage — very high-weight area.

🎯 CCEE Exam Tip (VERY IMPORTANT)
Threat modeling + Burp Suite + HTTP headers = guaranteed questions
Always think: asset → threat → vulnerability → impact
Labs = direct MCQs, not theory
