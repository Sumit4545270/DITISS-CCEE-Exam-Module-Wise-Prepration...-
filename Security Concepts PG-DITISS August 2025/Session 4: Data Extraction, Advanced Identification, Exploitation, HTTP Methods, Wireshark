Below is Session 4 crafted strictly from CDAC–DITISS CCEE + LAB mapping.
This session is hands-on heavy, so MCQs are scenario + tool + elimination based.

🎯 CCEE GOLDEN NOTES (Session 4)
GET = visible = risky
PUT + misconfig = file overwrite
Wireshark + HTTP = data leakage questions
Identification ≠ Exploitation (very common CDAC trap)
