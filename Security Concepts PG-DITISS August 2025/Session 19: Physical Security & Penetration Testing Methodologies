Excellent 👍
Session 19 is a management + methodology + tool-based session.
CDAC usually tests
👉 WHY physical security is needed, what affects it, and how penetration testing is done using Metasploit.
These are direct-scoring MCQs if concepts are clear.

Below is Session 19 MCQs in your exact CCEE format (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced).

🎯 CCEE EXAM GOLD (Session 19)
Physical access = total compromise
Tailgating = classic CDAC trap
Pen-test ≠ vulnerability scan
Metasploit = exploitation framework
Permission is mandatory
