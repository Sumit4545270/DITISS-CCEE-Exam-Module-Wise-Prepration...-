Excellent 👍
Session 18 is a mixed infrastructure + detection + OS attack session, and CDAC often asks
👉 definition + tool-purpose + attack vs defense logic MCQs
Labs (SNORT, Nagios, IDS/IPS, DMZ) are direct question sources.

Below is Session 18 MCQs in your exact CCEE format (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced).

🎯 CCEE EXAM GOLD (Session 18)
Backdoor = hidden persistent access
DDoS = availability killer
Biometric spoofing = authentication failure
IDS = detect | IPS = block
Honeypot = intentionally vulnerable
