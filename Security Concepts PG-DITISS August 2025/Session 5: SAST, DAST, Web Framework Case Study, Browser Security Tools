Great 👍
Session 5 is VERY IMPORTANT for CCEE because SAST vs DAST + tools + lab mapping almost always appear as direct or twisted MCQs.

Below is topper-level preparation, same pattern: Basic → Intermediate → Advanced (trap-based).

14. Which vulnerability is HARD to detect using SAST alone?
A. Buffer overflow
B. Authentication logic flaw
C. SQL Injection pattern
D. Hardcoded password

15. DAST tools often produce false positives because:

🎯 CCEE EXAM GOLD (Session 5)
SAST = before run (code)
DAST = during run (black box)
SAST + DAST = guaranteed MCQ
Browser tools = client-side protection only
