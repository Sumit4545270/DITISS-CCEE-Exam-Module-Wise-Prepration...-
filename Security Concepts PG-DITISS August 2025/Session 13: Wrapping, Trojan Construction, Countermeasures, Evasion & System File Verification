Session 13 is a classic malware–defense balance session — CDAC asks
👉 what Trojans are, how they are created, how they evade detection, and how to stop them.
Expect definition + “why/why not” trap MCQs.

Below is Session 13 MCQs in your exact CCEE format (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced).

🎯 CCEE EXAM GOLD (Session 13)
Wrapping = disguise
Trojan kits = low-skill malware
Polymorphism beats signatures
Behavior-based > signature-based
File integrity = integrity pillar
