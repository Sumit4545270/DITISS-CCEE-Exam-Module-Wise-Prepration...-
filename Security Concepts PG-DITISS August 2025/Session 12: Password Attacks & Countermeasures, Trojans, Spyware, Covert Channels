Excellent 👍
Session 12 is a high-scoring + lab-driven CCEE session because CDAC loves asking
👉 attack types vs countermeasures, online vs offline attacks, Trojans, covert channels
Most questions come directly from Kali lab understanding.

Below is Session 12 MCQs in your standard CDAC format (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced).

🎯 CCEE EXAM GOLD (Session 12)
Online vs Offline attacks = guaranteed MCQ
Salting defeats rainbow tables
Keyloggers beat even strong passwords
Reverse Trojans = outbound connection
Netcat = legit tool → malicious use = Trojan
