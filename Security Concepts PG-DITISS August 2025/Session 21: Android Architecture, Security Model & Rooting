Excellent 👍
Session 21 (Mobile Security – Android) is a guaranteed MCQ area because CDAC frequently asks
👉 architecture, security model, rooting risks, app fundamentals, and build process
Labs (Android Emulator) also convert directly into MCQs.

Below is Session 21 MCQs in your exact CDAC CCEE format (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced).
