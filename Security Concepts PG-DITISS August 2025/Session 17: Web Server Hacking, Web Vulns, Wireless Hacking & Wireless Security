Perfect 👍
Session 17 is a VERY HIGH-WEIGHT CCEE session because it mixes
👉 Web server hacking + web app vulns + wireless security & cracking
CDAC loves WEP vs WPA, sniffing, MAC spoofing, and “which attack/defense” MCQs.

Below is Session 17 MCQs in your exact CDAC format (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced) — lab-mapped and trap-ready.

🎯 CCEE EXAM GOLD (Session 17)
WEP = broken | WPA/WPA2/WPA3 = progressively stronger
MAC filtering ≠ security
Hidden SSID = false sense of security
Web login + no rate limit = brute force MCQ
Wireless = shared medium → sniffing risk
