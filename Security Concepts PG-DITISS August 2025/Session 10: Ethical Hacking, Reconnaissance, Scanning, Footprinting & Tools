Excellent 👍
Session 10 is one of the MOST IMPORTANT scoring sessions for CCEE because it mixes
👉 Ethical hacking basics + reconnaissance + scanning theory + tool-based labs
CDAC asks direct + tricky MCQs from exactly these points.

Below is Session 10 MCQs in your strict CDAC format (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced) — lab-mapped and elimination-friendly.

🎯 CCEE EXAM GOLD (Session 10)
Reconnaissance ≠ Scanning ≠ Exploitation
Passive recon = safe, active = risky
SYN/NULL/FIN/XMAS = stealth scans
Tools + purpose = guaranteed MCQs
