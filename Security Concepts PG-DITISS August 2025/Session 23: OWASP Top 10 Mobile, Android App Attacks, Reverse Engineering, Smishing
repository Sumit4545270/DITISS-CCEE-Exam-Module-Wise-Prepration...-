Excellent 👍
Session 23 (Mobile Security – OWASP Mobile + Android Attacks) is a VERY HIGH-RETURN CCEE session because CDAC frequently asks
👉 OWASP Top 10 Mobile mapping + attack scenarios + reverse engineering logic + smishing.
Labs directly convert into scenario-based MCQs.

Below is Session 23 MCQs in your standard CDAC CCEE format (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced).
