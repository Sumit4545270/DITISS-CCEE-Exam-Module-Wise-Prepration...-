Perfect 👍
Session 10 & 11 is one of the MOST SCORING + TRICKIEST sections in CDAC DITISS CCEE, especially because CDAC mixes theory + lab-tool correlation (Snort, OSSEC, Suricata, ELK).

Below are 30 exam-oriented MCQs (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced) crafted exactly from Session 10 & 11 + Lab 15 & 16, aligned to CCEE trap patterns.
