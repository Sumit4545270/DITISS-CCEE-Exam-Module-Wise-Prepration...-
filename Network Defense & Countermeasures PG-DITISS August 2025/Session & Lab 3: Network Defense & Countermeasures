A. Order of rule execution
B. Action when no rule matches
C. Packet logging level
D. Table priority

INTERMEDIATE MCQs (11–20)
11. A major limitation of packet filtering firewalls is that they:

D. Core switch

13. Which firewall type provides better protection against IP spoofing?
A. Packet filter
B. Stateful inspection firewall
C. Static firewall
D. Hub

14. NextGen firewalls can block traffic based on:
A. Only port numbers
B. Only IP addresses
C. Application identity (e.g., Facebook, BitTorrent)
D. MAC address only

15. Which iptables table is used for basic packet filtering?
A. nat
B. mangle
C. filter
D. raw

16. Which chain is evaluated for packets passing through the system (not destined locally)?

B. Accepted
C. Dropped
D. Redirected

18. Stateful firewall inspection mainly improves security by:
A. Encrypting packets
B. Tracking connection context
C. Filtering based on payload
D. Acting as proxy

B. App Control
C. Static routing
D. Port forwarding

20. iptables processes rules in which order?
A. Random order
B. Bottom to top
C. Top to bottom
D. Based on packet size

ADVANCED MCQs (21–30)
21. In iptables, which action immediately stops rule processing in a chain?
A. LOG
B. DROP
C. ACCEPT
D. RETURN

22. A packet enters a Linux firewall and is destined for another network. Which chain is MOST relevant?
A. INPUT
B. OUTPUT
C. FORWARD
D. POSTROUTING

23. Screened host firewall architecture improves security mainly by:
A. Eliminating internal routing
B. Adding layered defense
C. Removing need for firewall rules
D. Increasing bandwidth

24. NGFW application awareness is particularly effective against:
A. IP spoofing
B. Port-hopping applications
C. ARP poisoning
D. MAC flooding

25. Which scenario best demonstrates stateful inspection?
A. Blocking packets by port number
B. Allowing return traffic for established connections
C. Filtering based on URL
D. Blocking malformed packets only

26. In iptables, incorrect rule ordering can result in:
A. Kernel crash
B. Security bypass
C. Packet corruption
D. CPU overheating

27. Which table is processed FIRST by iptables?
A. filter
B. nat
C. raw
D. mangle

28. NGFW differs from traditional firewalls because it:
A. Operates only at layer 3
B. Combines firewall, IPS, and app control
C. Eliminates need for DMZ
D. Works without rules

29. A default ACCEPT policy with poor rule design is risky because it:
A. Drops valid traffic
B. Allows unintended traffic
C. Breaks routing
D. Disables logging

🔥 High-Yield CDAC Exam Focus (Session 3)
Packet Filtering 🆚 Stateful Inspection
Screened Host = Packet Filter + Bastion Host
iptables tables → chains → rules → order matters
NGFW = Layer-7 visibility + App Control
