Excellent 👍
Session 12 & 13 is a classic CDAC favorite because it blends architecture + IDS internals + DoS/DDoS + labs (Snort, OSSEC, Wireshark, iptables, LOIC). Expect scenario-based MCQs here.

Below are 30 CCEE-grade MCQs (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced) strictly aligned with Session 12 & 13 + Lab 17 & 18, designed for 90%+ scoring.
