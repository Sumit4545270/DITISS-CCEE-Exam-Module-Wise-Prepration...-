Session 3 is one of the MOST IMPORTANT + SCORING sessions for CCEE, especially for iptables, firewall internals, and scenario-based MCQs.
Below are 30 CDAC-aligned MCQs (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced) crafted exactly from Session 3 theory + Labs (3–6).

10. Which iptables target allows packet traversal?
A. DROP
B. REJECT

ADVANCED MCQs (21–30)
21. In iptables rule processing, packets are evaluated:
A. Randomly
B. From last rule to first
C. Sequentially top to bottom
D. Based on priority value

22. If INPUT chain default policy is DROP, and no rule matches, packet is:
A. Accepted
B. Logged only
C. Dropped
D. Forwarded

23. Stateful firewall blocks spoofed packets mainly by checking:

D. DROP

26. Internet sharing using iptables primarily requires:
A. DNS rules
B. NAT and FORWARD rules
C. INPUT rules only
D. Proxy firewall

27. Automating iptables using bash scripts is preferred because:
