Excellent 👍
Session 14 (Log Analyzer + SIEM) is a VERY HIGH-YIELD CCEE topic because CDAC loves log vs event vs incident, SIEM correlation, and Snort + Syslog + BASE integration questions.

Below are 30 CDAC-aligned MCQs (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced) strictly based on Session 14 + Lab 19, crafted to push you toward a 90%+ CCEE score.

14. Log normalization in SIEM helps to:
A. Encrypt logs
B. Convert logs into common format
C. Delete logs
D. Block traffic

15. Which Snort mode generates logs for SIEM?
A. Sniffer mode
B. Packet logger mode
C. IDS mode

17. Which protocol is MOST commonly used for log forwarding?
A. FTP
B. Syslog (UDP/TCP 514)
C. HTTP
D. SNMP

18. SIEM correlation rules are designed to detect:
A. Single events
B. Attack patterns across multiple logs
C. Encryption failures

B. Snort alerts
C. Firewall rules
D. VPN logs

20. Real-time alerting is a key advantage of:
A. Manual log review
B. SIEM
C. Packet capture
D. Antivirus

ADVANCED MCQs (21–30)
21. SIEM reduces false positives mainly through:
A. Encryption
B. Correlation of multiple events
C. Packet blocking
D. Rate limiting

22. A failed login followed by a successful login from same IP may indicate:
A. Normal activity
B. Brute-force attack
C. Malware infection
D. DoS attack

23. SIEM event triggering is based on:
A. Raw packet data
B. Predefined correlation rules
C. Firewall rules only
D. Antivirus signatures

24. Centralized logging is critical for:
A. Performance tuning
B. Forensics and compliance
C. Load balancing
D. Encryption

25. Syslog over TCP is preferred over UDP because it:
A. Is faster
B. Ensures reliable delivery
C. Encrypts logs
D. Uses less bandwidth

26. Snort rule “alert tcp any any → any 80” indicates:
A. Block HTTP traffic
B. Alert on TCP traffic to port 80
C. Encrypt HTTP traffic
D. Forward HTTP logs

27. SIEM storage must be protected because logs:
A. Increase bandwidth
B. Contain forensic evidence
C. Reduce performance
D. Encrypt traffic

28. BASE + Snort integration helps analysts to:

A. Prevent all attacks
B. Detect, correlate, and respond to incidents
C. Replace IDS
D. Replace firewall
