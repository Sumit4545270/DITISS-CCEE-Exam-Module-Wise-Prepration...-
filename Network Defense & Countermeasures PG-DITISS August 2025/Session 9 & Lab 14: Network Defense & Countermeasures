IDS / IPS + Attacks + Honeypots + tcpdump is a VERY HIGH-WEIGHT CCEE section. CDAC loves conceptual confusion (IDS vs IPS), attack mapping, security events, and lab-based tools (Honeynet, UAC, tcpdump).

Below are 30 CDAC-aligned MCQs (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced) strictly from Session (IDS/IPS) + Lab 14, tuned for PG-DITISS August 2025 CCEE.

Network Defense & Countermeasures – IDS / IPS (Session 9)
BASIC MCQs (1–10)
1. IDS stands for:
A. Internet Detection System
B. Intrusion Detection System
C. Internal Defense System
D. Integrated Detection Service

2. IPS differs from IDS mainly because IPS:
A. Detects attacks
B. Logs events
C. Actively blocks malicious traffic
D. Captures packets

3. IDS is primarily classified as a:
A. Preventive control
B. Detective control
C. Corrective control
D. Deterrent control

4. Which of the following is an example of a security event?
A. System boot
B. User login
C. Detected port scan
D. File read

5. Which attack targets availability?
A. Phishing
B. SQL Injection
C. DoS
D. Password reuse

6. Host-based IDS (HIDS) monitors:
A. Network traffic only
B. System logs and host activity
C. Firewall rules
D. Router traffic

7. Network-based IDS (NIDS) is usually deployed:
A. On each host
B. On network segments
C. Inside applications
D. On database server only

8. Honeypots are primarily used to:
A. Block attacks
B. Detect and study attackers
C. Replace firewall
D. Improve performance

9. tcpdump is best described as a:
A. Vulnerability scanner
B. Packet capture tool
C. Firewall
D. IDS

10. Which command checks tcpdump version?
A. tcpdump -l
B. tcpdump --help
C. tcpdump -v
D. tcpdump -V

INTERMEDIATE MCQs (11–20)
11. A false positive in IDS means:
A. Attack not detected
B. Normal activity flagged as attack
C. Attack blocked
D. System failure

12. Signature-based IDS detects attacks by:
A. Learning normal behavior
B. Matching known attack patterns
C. Blocking all traffic
D. Using encryption

13. Anomaly-based IDS is useful because it can detect:
A. Only known attacks
B. Zero-day attacks
C. Only malware
D. Firewall misconfigurations

14. Which attack is BEST detected using IDS?
A. Insider data theft
B. Network port scanning
C. Physical theft
D. Hardware failure

15. Security events become security incidents when they:
A. Are logged
B. Cause actual damage or violation
C. Are detected by IDS
D. Trigger alerts

16. Vulnerability due to poor system architecture is called:
A. Design vulnerability
B. Implementation vulnerability
C. Configuration vulnerability
D. Zero-day

17. C-DAC Distributed Honeynet System is mainly used to:
A. Block attackers
B. Deceive and analyze attackers
C. Scan vulnerabilities
D. Encrypt traffic

18. Dynamic honeypots differ from static honeypots because they:
A. Are offline
B. Adapt behavior based on attacks
C. Use antivirus
D. Are less secure

19. UAC (URL Analyzer and Classifier) helps mainly in:
A. Traffic routing
B. URL reputation and classification
C. Packet filtering
D. NAT

20. tcpdump captures packets using which library?
A. libnet
B. libpcap
C. netstat
D. syslog

ADVANCED MCQs (21–30)
21. IPS deployment inline can introduce which risk?
A. Reduced visibility
B. Network latency or false blocking
C. No detection
D. Data leakage

22. Which IDS placement provides BEST network visibility?
A. Behind firewall
B. Inline like IPS
C. Network choke point
D. On endpoint only

23. Anomaly-based IDS false positives occur mainly due to:
A. Weak signatures
B. Changing network behavior
C. Encryption
D. Poor hardware

24. IDS evasion techniques include:
A. Encryption and fragmentation
B. Load balancing
C. NAT
D. VLAN tagging

25. Honeypots should NEVER be:
A. Isolated
B. Monitored
C. Placed in production LAN
D. Logged

26. tcpdump is often preferred over Wireshark on servers because it:
A. Has GUI
B. Is lightweight and CLI-based
C. Blocks traffic
D. Acts as IDS

27. Mapping vulnerability → attack → event → incident is important for:
A. Performance tuning
B. Incident response
C. Load balancing
D. Encryption

28. Which scenario BEST represents IPS functionality?
A. Alert on malware
B. Log suspicious traffic
C. Drop malicious packets in real time
D. Capture packets

29. From CCEE perspective, IDS and IPS together provide:
A. Complete security
B. Detection and prevention layers
C. Encryption
D. Authentication

30. Which statement BEST aligns with CDAC philosophy?
A. IDS eliminates attacks
B. IPS replaces firewall
C. Security monitoring is continuous
D. Honeypots block hackers
