Great 👍
Session 4 is very important for CCEE because CDAC loves Wireshark display filters, packet-analysis logic, and iptables real-world use cases (Port Forwarding + Fail2ban).

Below are 30 MCQs (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced), tightly mapped to Session 4 theory + Lab 7, with exam-style traps.

🔥 Very High Probability CCEE Areas (Session 4)
✔ Wireshark display vs capture filters
✔ TCP Flags (SYN, ACK, RST)
✔ Port Forwarding (PREROUTING + NAT)
✔ Fail2ban workflow (Logs → iptables → Block)
✔ Wireshark as Detective control
