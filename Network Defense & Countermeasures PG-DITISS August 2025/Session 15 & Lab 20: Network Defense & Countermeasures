Excellent 👍
Session 15 (Snort Testing + IDS Architecture + IDS Evasion + Nagios) is a classic CDAC CCEE trap section because it mixes IDS internals + evasion techniques + monitoring tools (Nagios). Expect conceptual + lab-scenario MCQs here.

Below are 30 high-quality MCQs (10 Basic + 10 Intermediate + 10 Advanced) strictly aligned with Session 15 + Lab 20, crafted for PG-DITISS August 2025 CCEE with a 90%+ score target.
