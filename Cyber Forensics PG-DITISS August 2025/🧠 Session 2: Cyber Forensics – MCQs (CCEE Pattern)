🔥 CCEE EXAM SHORTCUT (Very Important)
Preservation + Chain of Custody = Evidence Validity
If option mentions “without documentation / no hash / no log” → WRONG
Network forensics → data movement, exfiltration, traffic
Before incident = preparation + IR plan + team

I’ll continue this same strict CCEE-focused pattern till your full Cyber Forensics syllabus is exam-ready 💯
