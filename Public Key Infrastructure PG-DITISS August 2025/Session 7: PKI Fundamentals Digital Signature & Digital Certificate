🎯 CCEE QUICK REVISION (SESSION 7)
Digital Signature = Hash + Private Key
Verification = Public Key
Certificate binds identity ↔ public key
CA establishes trust
CRL / OCSP → certificate revocation
X.509 = certificate standard
🔥 FINAL NOTE FOR CCEE
If you master Sessions 4–7 of PKI, you can easily score 80–90% in PKI questions.
