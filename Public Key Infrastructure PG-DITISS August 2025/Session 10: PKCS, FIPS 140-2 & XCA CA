🧪 LAB PART (VERY IMPORTANT – PRACTICAL + VIVA)
🔹 LAB 1: Create CA using XCA
Steps:
Open XCA
Create New Database
Generate Private Key
Create Root CA Certificate (self-signed)
Set validity, key usage, CA flag
✔ This CA will sign other certificates

🔹 LAB 2: Issue Website Certificate
Domain: https://www.ditiss.local
Steps:

Create Private Key for website
Create CSR with CN = www.ditiss.local
Use CA → Sign CSR
Generate Server Certificate
Export certificate + key
🔹 LAB 3: Configure Website (HTTPS)
Configure web server (Apache/Nginx)

Load:

Server certificate
Private key
CA certificate
Result: HTTPS works but browser shows warning

🔹 LAB 4: Remove Browser Warning
Steps:

Export CA certificate

Import CA cert into:

Browser Trust Store
Reload https://www.ditiss.local

✔ Warning removed
✔ Trust established

🎯 CCEE QUICK REVISION (SESSION 10)
PKCS = RSA standards
FIPS 140-2 = crypto module security
Root CA signs server certificates
Self-signed ≠ trusted
Browser trusts CA, not website directly
XCA = full PKI lifecycle tool
🔥 YOU HAVE NOW COMPLETED ENTIRE PKI (SESSION 1–10) 🔥
