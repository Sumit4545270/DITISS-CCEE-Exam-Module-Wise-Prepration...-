🧪 LAB PART (VERY IMPORTANT FOR VIVA + CCEE)
🔹 LAB 1: Create Digital Signature using XCA
Steps:
Open XCA
Create New Database
Generate Private Key
Create Certificate (Self-signed or CA-signed)
Export certificate (if required)
🔹 LAB 2: Digitally Sign a Word Document
Open Word → File → Info
Select Protect Document
Choose Add a Digital Signature
Select certificate created in XCA
Sign document
✔ Any modification → signature invalid

🔹 LAB 3: Digitally Sign a PDF Document
Open PDF in Adobe Reader
Tools → Certificates → Digitally Sign
Select area → choose certificate
Save signed PDF
✔ Integrity + non-repudiation ensured

🎯 CCEE QUICK REVISION (SESSION 9)
Aadhaar e-Sign = legally valid
Uses OTP/Biometrics
No physical token required
Time stamping = proof of time
XCA = certificate management tool
Document change → signature invalid
🔥 YOU HAVE NOW COMPLETED ENTIRE PKI (SESSION 1–9) 🔥
