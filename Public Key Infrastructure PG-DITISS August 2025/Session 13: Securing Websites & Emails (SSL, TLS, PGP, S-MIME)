PKI – Sessions 11 & 12 are very important for modern security questions in CCEE.
Expect conceptual + comparison-based + real-world scenario MCQs (SSO, OAuth, FIDO, Zero Trust are hot topics).

Below is a DITISS-aligned, CCEE-ready MCQ set covering both sessions together.

🎯 CCEE QUICK REVISION (SESSIONS 11 & 12)
Authentication = identity verification
MFA = something you know + have + are
SSO = convenience + single point of failure
OAuth = authorization, not authentication
OpenID = authentication
FIDO = passwordless, public-key based
Zero Trust = never trust, always verify
