PKI – Session 8 is core PKI theory and very frequently asked in CCEE.
Most questions come from CA role, trust models, certificate lifecycle, CRL vs OCSP, and certificate types.

Below is a DITISS-aligned, CCEE-focused MCQ set.

🎯 CCEE QUICK REVISION (SESSION 8)
CA = issues & manages certificates
Root CA = self-signed
CSR contains public key
CRL = offline, OCSP = real-time
Hierarchical trust = most common
EV certificates = higher validation
